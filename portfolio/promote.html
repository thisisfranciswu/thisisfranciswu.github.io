<h2>Key Decisions</h2>
<h3>Identifying the Beachhead</h3>
<p>Instead of a generic tool, I used campaign data to find where the ML performed best (e.g., Home Services). This allowed us to build a "narrow and deep" UX rather than a "shallow and broad" one.</p>
<h3>Focus on Trust</h3>
<p>SMBs have frequently been burned by agencies' empty promises. So I designed for radical transparency instead, allowing SMBs to visualize demand and ROI before asking for a credit card.</p>

<h3>Self-Serve Empowerment</h3>
<p>To disrupt the high-overhead agency model, I pivoted to a fully automated, self-service platform. This gave SMBs direct control over their ad schedules and budgets, providing the pricing transparency and autonomy they were missing from traditional managed services.</p>

<h3>Designing for Localization</h3>
<p>To move fast across English and French markets, I designed a responsive UI that can handle any text length, bypassing the need for manual design tweaks for every language.</p>

<h3>Frictionless Whitelabeling</h3>
<p>Since SMBs often lack brand kits, I limited customization to a single logo and one color. This constraint ensured a professional, whitelabeled result while removing the "blank canvas" paralysis for users without design assets.</p>

<h2>Reality Check</h2>
<h3>The Scaling Trap</h3>
<p>We succumbed to internal pressure to scale across hundreds of verticals prematurely. This diluted our focus and confirmed my initial research that a vertical-specific approach was more sustainable.</p>
<h3>Missed Validation</h3>
<p>We relied on existing agency channels for distribution rather than a pure product-led growth (PLG) model, which limited our ability to fully test the self-service acquisition funnel.</p>

<h2>Key Lessons</h2>
<h3>Transparency as a UX Pillar</h3>
<p>For skeptical SMBs, proving the "why" through demand visualization was more important than the "what." Trust is the primary conversion driver for high-stakes automated tools.</p>
<h3>The Power of Constraints</h3>
<p>Limiting customization didn't just simplify the build; it ensured every user-generated landing page maintained a professional baseline, protecting the product's perceived quality at scale.</p>
<h3>Depth Before Breadth</h3>
<p>Mastering a single vertical provides the high-quality data ML needs to truly outperform human experts. My experience with Promote solidified that sustainable growth in AI products comes from focused depth before broad expansion.</p>

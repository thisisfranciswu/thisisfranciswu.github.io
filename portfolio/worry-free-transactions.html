<h2>Process</h2>
<h3>The "No News is Good News" Pivot</h3>
<p>While the initial request was for "more logs," I realized users only wanted to know when to intervene, leading to a "set-and-forget" philosophy that respects user attention.</p>
<h3>Working Backwards</h3>
<p>Used a mock feature announcement to clearly articulate the problem framing and shape of the solution before a single pixel of the actual tool was designed.</p>

<h3>High-Fidelity for High Stakes</h3>
<p>Leveraged a mature design system to skip wireframes and present high-fidelity renders, which was essential for managing the expectations of change-sensitive financial clients.</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>A predictive risk-scoring system that flags documents, prioritizes them in the inbox, and allows users to "snooze" or resolve issues before they expire.</p>

<h2>Reality Check</h2>
<h3>Shifting Priorities</h3>
<p>Despite clear ROI, the feature was deprioritized to divert resources to escalating requests.</p>
<h3>The Lesson</h3>
<p>Anything can be sidelined by shifting business priorities. By capturing intent early through a "Working Backwards" approach, I created a durable blueprint that can be reactivated the moment resources allow.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<h3>Zero-Waste Handoff</h3>
<p>Provided Product Marketing with a head start via the "working backwards" mock announcement and eliminated future ramp-up time for engineering by securing high-fidelity, design-system-backed specs early.</p>
<h3>Ongoing Advocacy</h3>
<p>Amazon's approach of "Working Backwards" continues to be one of my favorite methods to ensure future projects are grounded in clear, measurable business outcomes.</p>

<h2>Validation</h2>
<div class="impact-items breakout">
  <div class="impact-item">
    <h3>Scale</h3>
    <p class="impact-item-description">Secured a strategic partnership with a 110K-member Facebook community (Moms Who Need Wine) to drive early adoption.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="impact-item">
    <h3>Innovation</h3>
    <p class="impact-item-description">Featured by Robert Scoble for pioneering the "scan-to-lookup" UX using RedLaser barcode scanning technology.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="impact-item">
    <h3>Real-World Testing</h3>
    <p class="impact-item-description">Validated the UX at 2010 SF Vintners Market, facilitating wine discover across 100+ wineries in a high-density, high-distraction environment.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<h3>Social Reciprocity</h3>
<p>Designed the activity feed to prioritize friend data over "expert" ratings, creating a safe space for users who felt intimidated by traditional wine culture.</p>

<h3>Reducing Data Entry Friction</h3>
<p>I advocated for barcode scanning to remove the "manual entry" friction of the wine aisle, moving the user from curiosity to "Check-in" in seconds.</p>

<h3>Closing the Commerce Gap</h3>
<p>Unlocked significant user and business value by facilitating the immediate purchase of desirable wines with "Nearby Sellers" integration.</p>

<h3>Iterative Gamification</h3>
<p>Developed a "Wine Flight" learning experience, taking inspiration from Gowalla and Foursquare to turn wine education into a series of achievable, social "stamps."</p>

<h2>Why It Failed</h2>
<h3>The Data Bottleneck</h3>
<p>Our biggest UX hurdle wasn't the UI; it was the data. We struggled with unstructured wine data, often forcing users into high-friction manual entry that led to drop-off.</p>
<h3>Technical Constraints</h3>
<p>In 2010, relying on third-party barcode libraries (RedLaser) and early-gen camera hardware meant the "magical" scan often failed in low-light environments.</p>
<h3>Strategic Fragmentation</h3>
<p>The core product lost momentum when resources were diverted to other initiatives such as bespoke white-label solutions for partners like the SAQ.</p>
<h3>Lesson Learned</h3>
<p>I realized that UX cannot solve for a lack of product focus. No amount of gamification can save an app if investment in its growth is deprioritized for side ventures.</p>

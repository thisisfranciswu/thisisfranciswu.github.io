<h2>Process and Key Decisions</h2>
<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>I spearheaded a comprehensive audit of OneSpan’s flagship product to identify high-risk inconsistencies and accessibility gaps, providing the data-driven roadmap for standardization:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identifying reusable patterns to accelerate design and dev velocity.</li>
  <li>Mapping visual and functional inconsistencies to reduce support costs.</li>
  <li>Isolating ADA compliance risks to shield the company from legal liability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The "Prescriptive" Library</h3>
<p>To account for varying levels of accessibility knowledge, I built the system with guardrails that made the accessible path the path of least resistance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Form controls include labels and help text by default to ensure no critical context is ever missing.</li>
  <li>Deliberately excluded problematic anti-patterns such as tooltips, disabled buttons, and placeholder text.</li>
  <li>Components feature pre-validated, accessible color pairings so designers never have to guess "what color is compliant?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stress Testing via Workshops</h3>
<p>I validated the library’s flexibility by having designers use it to rebuild complex, external pages like Twitter. This revealed component gaps immediately and served as a training ground for designers to navigate the system's "principled constraints" without falling back on old habits.</p>

<h2>Strategic Insights and Evergreen Lessons</h2>
<h3>Mandate vs. Reality</h3>
<p>I was recruited specifically to spearhead the design system, yet despite four years of proven ROI in design velocity and risk mitigation, I couldn't bridge the gap to a company-wide engineering rollout because leadership remained focused on short-term features over long-term infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Strategic Pivot</h3>
<p>Despite being hired to build a cross-functional system, I had to adapt my strategy when engineering buy-in stalled. I pivoted to focus on maximizing the UX team's internal efficiency, resulting in a ~400k+ component insertion rate even without a mirrored code library.</p>
<h3>Accessibility Strategy</h3>
<p>This experience drove me to codify my approach to accessibility and systems thinking. I published four articles to share the deeper strategic frameworks I developed during this journey:</p>
